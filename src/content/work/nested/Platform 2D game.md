Project Overview:

I developed a 2D platformer game inspired by Super Mario Bros, featuring five unique levels. This project allowed me to build upon the skills I acquired in my previous project while learning new tools and techniques.

Skills and Knowledge Acquired:

Enhanced Unity Skills:
- Cinemachine: Integrated Cinemachine to create dynamic camera movements and follow the player smoothly.
- Tilemap Tool: Utilized Unity's Tilemap tool to design and construct the game levels efficiently.

Animation:
- Animator: Created and managed character animations using Unity's Animator, including running, jumping, and shooting animations.

AI and Game Mechanics:
- Basic Zombie AI: Implemented simple AI behaviors for zombie enemies, including patrolling and attacking the player.
- Damage and Health Systems: Developed systems for player and enemy health, including taking damage and health regeneration.
- Checkpoint and Respawn Systems: Implemented checkpoints that save player progress and respawn the player upon death.
- Death System: Created a death system that handles player death animations and game over states.
- Final Boss: Designed and coded a challenging final boss with unique behaviors and attack patterns.

Game Management:
- Scene Management: Learned how to switch between scenes for level transitions, menus, and the ending sequence.
- User Interface: Created ending UI elements to display game completion and final scores.

Technical Skills:
- Advanced C# Programming: Enhanced scripting skills by implementing complex game mechanics and interactions.
- Animator Controller: Mastered the use of Animator Controllers to manage multiple animations and transitions.
- Physics and Collision Detection: Improved understanding of Unity's physics system to handle character movement and interactions with the environment.

Problem Solving:
- Debugging and Optimization: Applied advanced debugging techniques to solve complex issues and optimize game performance.
- Level Design Challenges: Addressed design challenges to create engaging and balanced levels.

I did not create Assets.
