Personal Project\
Duration : 8 days

Project Overview:

I developed a 3-level platformer game inspired by Crash Bandicoot. This project allowed me to consolidate and apply the skills I learned from the Unity Essentials (12 hours) and Unity Junior Programmer Pathway (35 hours) courses.

Courses Completed:
- Unity Essentials: Covered the basics of Unity, including the interface, basic scripting, and simple game mechanics.
- Unity Junior Programmer Pathway: Provided an in-depth understanding of C# programming in Unity, including more advanced game mechanics and problem-solving techniques.

Skills and Knowledge Applied:

Enhanced Unity Skills:
- Advanced Level Design: Designed three unique levels with increasing difficulty, incorporating various obstacles and collectibles.
- ProBuilder: Utilized the ProBuilder tool to create detailed and varied level environments efficiently.
- Animator: Created and implemented animations for character movements and interactions using Unity's Animator.

Game Mechanics:
- Character Movement and Control: Implemented responsive character controls, including running, jumping, and interacting with the environment.
- Checkpoint and Respawn Systems: Implemented checkpoints and respawn mechanics to enhance gameplay flow.
- Collectibles and Scoring: Created a scoring system that tracks player progress and rewards collecting items throughout the levels.

Technical Skills:
- C# Programming: Wrote and optimized scripts to handle game mechanics, player controls, and interactions without external assistance.
- Physics and Collision Detection: Improved understanding of Unity's physics system to handle interactions between the player and environment.
- User Interface: Designed and implemented UI elements to display player progress and level completion status.

Problem Solving:
- Debugging and Optimization: Applied advanced debugging techniques to solve complex issues and ensure smooth gameplay.
- Independent Learning and Implementation: Successfully implemented all game features without external help, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills and self-reliance.
